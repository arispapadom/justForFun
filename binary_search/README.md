Binary search algorithm is userd for searching an element in a sorted list. Just hit in the middle and you will get what you want. You will take it within at most log2(n) tries (n is the number of list). Not have a sorted list? cd ../quicksort




You can use this as a python library.

Usage:
```
  from binary_search import *
  
  a = list(range(1,100))

  x=input("Give number to search:")

  if(a.Bsearch(int(x))):
  	print("Found")
  else:
  	print("Not found")
```
